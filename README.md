# Internet-Computer-Internship-Bootcamp-Final-Project

I tried to make the project on WSL via VSCode but I have troubles with my WSL. I would have lost all my project if I didn't backup my .mo file.

This project is made via Motoko Playground, so I could not bring the rest of the files.

This is my Animal Blockchain System that supports adding animals, delisting them, and finding them by their various details.
